## About The Project
This project provides a small-scale but fully functional Language Learning Model (LLM) built from scratch
using PyTorch. The model is specifically designed and trained on medical text from the `TheBlueScrubs-v1-fixed` dataset. 
It serves as a learning resource and a starting point for experimenting with LLM architectures, training techniques, and their application in specialized domains like medicine.
